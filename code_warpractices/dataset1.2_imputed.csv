(Du Tertre 1667). ""If the enemy resisted and wounded one of their warriors, the wounded man’s companions did their utmost to rescue him, for they considered it outrageous to abandon a comrade-in-arms in the hands of the enemy (Rochefort 1666 [ 1658 ]: 322 ; Martire d’Anghiera 1966 [ 1555 ]: 80 r– 81 v)...Kalinago believed that whenever a man’s will to go to war wavered, Maboya, a demonic being, beat him in his dreams, both to punish him and to motivate him to go to battle (Rochefort 1666 [ 1658 ]: 282 ). They also believed that the souls of courageous warriors went to dwell in a paradisiacal island after death, where they passed the time dancing, playing, and feasting and were served by numerous Arrouague (Lokono) and African slaves. In contrast, the vital essences of those who “were cowardly and afraid to go to the wars against their Enemies, do after death serve the Arouagues, who inhabit barren and desert Countries beyond the Mountains” (Rochefort 1666 [ 1658 ]: 289 ). In summary, then, the capacity to wage war was a constitutive aspect of Kalinago manhood...A similar logic lies behind the extreme importance that these societies placed in retrieving the bodies of dead fellow warriors. Early sources report that the Kalinago (Rochefort 1666 [ 1658 ]: 322 ) and Chiriguaná (AGI 1735 : fol. 56 r) did everything they could to recover the bodies of fallen companions. Although we lack the evidence, it is probable that this was also true of the other societies in the sample, since, as Chaumeil ( 2007 : 262 – 263 ) suggests, this is a widespread Amerindian practice. The sources insist that leaving the body of a fellow warrior behind was perceived as a shameful act. And this might have been the case. More crucial, however, seems to have been the idea of preventing the enemy from keeping the vitalities of the fallen. In a political economy where life is the scarcest resource, success is measured, not only by capturing from rival groups as large an amount of potentialities of life as possible, but also by preventing the enemy from reducing one’s own stock of life forces.""

Various factors contributed to this mobilization. First, there was the resentment of the nobility of Mbailundu over Portuguese military presence in their country and its attempts to overthrow their sovereignity. This was especially felt by the family line that had ruled Mbailundu at the time of the armed Portuguese intrusion. Secondly, the nobility was partially successful in calling for general mobilization in areas nominally vassal to Mbailundu, such as Wambu, Civanda, Soke, Ciyaka, Ngalanga, Bimbe and Cipeyo, and even those independent of Mbailundu because of the general resentment and distrust of Portuguese's motives after the attacks on Viye in 1890 and Mbailundu in 1896. Thirdly, the nobility was able to attract some loyalty from the lower classes because the Portuguese demands for porters had alienated the formerly independent porters with aspirations to become traders and join the upper class just at the time when trade and opportunity was growing. 64 The lower class resentment of their own rulers' behavior was put aside for a time to combat a greater enemy.""

In this respect, one can classify these people as a very specific and militant subset of the proto-Sunna; their hallmark activity was pursuing the Jihad while keeping themselves free of worldly encumbrances and ties with those whom they considered to be impure – first and foremost, the government.” (Tor 2007: 45). “The exhortations of the Friday sermon to self-sacrifice in God's path were paralleled on the battlefield by the qussas* and qurra'*.
