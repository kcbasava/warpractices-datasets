The older male captives taken in war, and sometimes the younger ones, were anciently burned. The women and children, unless killed on the spot, were adopted into the tribe and so were those males whose lives had been spared (167) Regarding the devotion of prisoners to death in advance Adair speaks more at length elsewhere. As already stated, the younger captives were frequently adopted and the lives of others were sometimes spared, but all would be killed indiscriminately if, before they started upon the expedition, the warriors had devoted them to death. Apparently this devotion to death might take many forms. They might vow to kill all they should meet on a certain trail, or all of a certain nation, or all during a certain time. The old Indians informed Adair that formerly they had devoted to death only the guilty and had adopted the rest, 19 but inasmuch as a clan or tribe according to Indian law was responsible for the actions of all of its members this signifies little (423). ""Then if one of the other nation is seen by them he is certainly destroyed; their petty wars are wars of extermination. They commence by small parties on venture, not man against man but tribe against tribe. It is a praiseworthy action for a man or a party of men to kill the women and children of their enemy, more so than to kill a man, who is frequently in the forest, whereas to kill a woman shews evidently that he [the slayer] was not afraid to go into his enemy's country but achieved the manly deed in their very house door and escaped.""

In some cases wars were successfully fought without captives being taken. In the campaign against the southern Pacific coast towns, for example, King Ahuitzotl told the warriors to kill everyone and take no captives, because the battle was too far from home...The people of Oztoman refused to pay tribute to the Aztecs, so the army attacked, broke through the fortifications, burned the temple, and killed the people, sparing only the children. Then they sent emissaries to Alahuiztlan (8 km. or 5 mi.) asking for tribute, which the town refused to give, and the Aztecs attacked and razed the city as well.
