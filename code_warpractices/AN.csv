The heads of the vanquished were cut off and carried in triumph, and these, as well as the bodies of the slain, were taken to the settlements in proof of their prowess by either party, unless one party were crushed. These heads and headless bodies were afterwards given over to the children for further insult, who [Page 250] were accustomed to drag them about the settlements in triumph, and then to spear, stone, or mutilate them still further, as they might choose."" (Stair 1897: 249). “No hero at the Grecian games rejoiced more over his chaplet than did the Samoan glory in the distinction of having cut off a man's head...These heads were piled up in a heap in the malae or public assembly.” (Turner 1884) *headhunting coded absent in Pulotu based on same sources; assume due to specific def of headhunting they use [Stair, John B. 1897.
